# Precession of Mercury's Perihelion

## Introduction
We examine the precession of Mercury's perihelion under the effects of General Relativity. From early years the observed value of the angle could not agree with the predictions given by Newtonian theory. However Einstein's theory of General Relativity managed to explain the remaining part of the precession angle.

## Program Compilation
To use the program for the simulation of the planet orbit, download the files using:
```
git clone https://github.com/christosvlahos/Precession-of-Mercury-s-Perihelion
```
To compile it, run ```make``` in your terminal and it'll create an executable named ```mercury```.
Finally run ```./mercury``` to run the simulation. The ```main.cpp``` file uses the data structures containing position and velocity in x and y direction and the functions defined in ```functions.cpp``` and ```fun.h```.
<br />
To get the results 5 input parameters are needed:
1. Eccentricity value
2. Total simulation time in years
3. GR correction parameter value
4. Name of file to store coordinates of the orbit and times
5. Name of file to store precession angles and their times

<br />
Note that although the program creates separate files for different set of parameters in the Jupyter notebook ```Perihelion.ipynb``` used for the statistical analysis of the results we have already merged the files into one to avoid repeating the same procedure too many times. The way to do it for ```.csv``` files is to run in the command line 
```
paste -d ',' name1.csv ... namex.csv > final.csv
```
